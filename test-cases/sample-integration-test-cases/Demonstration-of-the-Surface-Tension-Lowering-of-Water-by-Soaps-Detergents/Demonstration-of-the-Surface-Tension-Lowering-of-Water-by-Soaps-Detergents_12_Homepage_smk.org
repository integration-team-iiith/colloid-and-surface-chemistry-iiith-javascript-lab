* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/colloid-and-surface-chemistry-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/sample-integration-test-cases/Demonstration-of-the-Surface-Tension-Lowering-of-Water-by-Soaps-Detergents/Demonstration-of-the-Surface-Tension-Lowering-of-Water-by-Soaps-Detergents_01_Usability_smk.org][Demonstration-of-the-Surface-Tension-Lowering-of-Water-by-Soaps-Detergents_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil
     
* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Demonstration of the Surface Tension Lowering of Water by Soaps/Detergents" link.
  +  Check if there are any distortions, spelling mistakes and junk
     characters in the Simulation page.

* Expected result

  + The home page of "Demonstration of the Surface Tension Lowering of Water by Soaps/Detergents" experiment should be displayed on the screen.
